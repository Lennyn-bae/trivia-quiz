# Reflection

The Quiz has two levels as was requested: easy and hard. Type of questions - boolean.

I used this API endpoint https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&difficulty=easy&type=boolean, so for now there is a limit of questions - 10. You can set it to whatever number you like, but there is no instruction for results page if you have more than 10 questions. For example, I put 20 questions and results page should show me 10 stars or none at all? Maybe we should use percentage for correct answers. it gives me food for thought.
